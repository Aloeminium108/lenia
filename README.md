# GPU-Accelerated Lenia

Lenia is a continuous generalization of Conway's Game of Life first proposed and implemented by Bert Wang-Chak Chan (For more info please click [here](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html)). It is a cellular automata which is defined by:
- A scalar field, $A: \vec{x} \mapsto [0, 1]$
- A growth function, $G: [0, 1] \mapsto [-1, 1]$
- And a kernel, $\usepackage{euscript} K: \EuScript{N} \mapsto \EuScript{S}$
